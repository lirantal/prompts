# Detailed Design

```plaintext
Your task is to create a detailed design document for this project based on its existing source-code and any written tests and write this to a `DESIGN.md` file in the `docs/` directory. Following are the guidelines for the design document:

- If a `docs/PROJECT.md` file exists, you should read it to receive a high-level project overview from a technical perspective of how this project is set up.
- If a `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` file exists, you should read it to understand the requirements and scope of this project.
- Research and analyze the requirements in alignment with the project's overview, tech stack, the project's requirements, and the high-level architecture and key-patterns.
- Based on your analysis, create a detailed design document that should include:
  - a suggested architecture
  - components and interfaces
  - data models
  - APIs
  - error handling
  - testing strategy
  - implementation considerations

The goal of this task is to create a detailed and comprehensive design document that will serve as the frame of reference for future software development work to extend this project with new features, code refactoring, writing tests, and fixing bugs.
