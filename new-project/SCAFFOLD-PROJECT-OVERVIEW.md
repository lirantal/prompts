# Scaffold project overview

- Condition - new project, no specs or docs.
- Goal - create a `PROJECT.md` file for a project

```plaintext
You are now set to begin work in a new project. To optimize for your success you should review and analyze this project and create a `PROJECT.md` file in the `docs/` directory that should contain the following information from your learning and analysis of the project:

- Project Overview
- Development Commands
- Tech Stack
- General Project Architecture & Key Patterns

The goal of this task is to create a holistic project overview from a technical perspective of software engineering so that it can act as your foundation and basis for future software development work on this project such as developing new features, writing tests, and fixing bugs.
