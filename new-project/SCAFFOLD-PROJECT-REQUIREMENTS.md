# The PRD: Product Requirements Document

```plaintext
Your task is to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this project based on its existing source-code and any written tests and write this PRD to a `REQUIREMENTS.md` file in the `docs/` directory. Following are the guidelines for the PRD:

- If a `docs/PROJECT.md` file exists, you should read it to receive a high-level project overview from a technical perspective of how this project is set up.
- Read the source code to analyze and extrapolate the requirements, the overall functionality, and the scope of this project.
- Read the written test code, if available, to analyze and extrapolate from them the requirements, and the acceptance criteria.
- The PRD should include a section for the introduction to the project, in brief.
- The PRD should include a section for the goal of the project.
- The PRD should include a section for dependencies of the project, if any. Dependencies are third-party APIs, data feeds, and other resources that the project is highly dependent on.
- The PRD should create sections that breaks-down requirements that each describe the capability and then for each requirement include a sub-section for a list of acceptance criteria.

The goal of this task is to create a detailed and comprehensive product requirements document that details to the best extent this project's scope and the requirements it needs to fulfill so that it can act as a foundational reference for future software development work such as developing new features, writing tests, and fixing bugs.
