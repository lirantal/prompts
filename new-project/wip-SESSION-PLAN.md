## Plan & Review

- Always start in a Plan mode to make a plan.
- Your plan should be a detailed implementation plan that includes your reasoning for choosing them and a task list break-down.
- After you establish a plan, write the plan to a tasks list in `TASK-NAME.md`.
- Once you write the plan, ask me to review and approve it. Never proceed to implement without my approval.

## During implementation

- While you implement the plan, you should update the tasks in the task file you created.
- After you complete each task you should update the task file to reflect it and append detailed descriptions of the task so it can be handed over to another engineer.
